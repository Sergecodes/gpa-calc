    "Explanation 1st P": "Each course has a credit, which is like its coefficient and determines its 'weight'.
        The 'points' obtained for each course is obtained as shown on the table above, and depends on the marks obtained. <br/>
        To get the GPA of a given semester, multiply each course's credit by its points, then find the sum.
        Now divide that sum by the sum of the credits of each course of that semester.",
    "Explanation 2nd P": "Suppose in a semester, there are 3 courses; Course A, Course B and Course C with credits 2, 3, and 4 respectively. <br/>
        Let's assume a student scored 70, 85 and 49 in the different courses. <br/>
        The grades obtained are B+, A and C- respectively and amount to the points 3.30, 4.00 and 1.70 . <br/>
        To get the GPA, we take (2*3.30 + 3*4.00 + 4*1.70) &divide; (2 + 3 + 4) = 25.40 &divide; 9 which gives
        <strong> 2.82 / 4</strong>.",
